<body>a passionate web developer currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development and have a particular interest in building responsive web applications. My aim is to create seamless user experiences while keeping up with the latest trends in technology.

    In my academic career, Iâ€™ve worked on multiple projects in areas such as database management, data structures, and networking, and have gained hands-on experience with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy transforming ideas into functional solutions.
    
    Apart from coding, I love staying updated with the latest trends in tech, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. My ambition is to continue learning, growing, and applying my skills in real-world projects that make an impact.
